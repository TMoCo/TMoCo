Hi, I'm [@TMoCo](https://github.com/TMoCo) and I have just started my career in software engineering at the BBC.

I'm interested in how technology is used to share content, knowledge and new experiences to people from around the world.\
I also enjoy learning about computer graphics and the mathematical concepts underpinning them.
