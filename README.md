Hi, welcome to my GitHub space üëã

Feel free to explore my past projects and reuse their source code. If used outside of your own personal project, please remember to accredit the code appropriately. üëç

I'm a software engineer at the BBC with interests and experience in:
- cloud infrastructure as code and monitoring in AWS
- microservice and full stack web app development, mainly JS front-ends (React) and Java-like backends (Java Spring, Scala)
- API design and frameworks (REST, GraphQL, event driven)
- data bases
- Agile development
- designing unit/integration tests and TDD
- core web technologies (JS, HTML, CSS) and modern web apis like WebGl and WebASM
- serverless and container technology (lambdas, docker, kubernetes)
- Ci/Cd workflows, scripts and automation
- high performance graphics
- principles and practices of good software engineering

I am most familiar with developing front-ends and component libraries for web apps with TS and react, but have gained experience managing and building back-end services and apis.
