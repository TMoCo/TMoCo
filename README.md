Hi, welcome to my GitHub space üëã

Feel free to explore my past projects and reuse their source code. If used outside of your own personal project, please remember to accredit the code appropriately. üëç

I'm a software engineer at the BBC with interests and experience in:
- cloud development with AWS
- microservice and full stack web app development, mainly TS front-ends (React) and JVM(Java, Scala)/Node backends 
- API design and frameworks (REST, GraphQL, RPC, event-driven/WS) and networking infrastructure 
- data management, domain mondelling
- Agile development practices
- designing unit/integration tests with BDD and TDD
- core web technologies and modern web apis like WebGl and WebASM
- containers (docker, kubernetes) and serverless (lambdas, step-functions)
- Ci/Cd workflows, scripts and automation
- high performance graphics
- principles and practices of good software engineering

I am most familiar with developing front-ends apps and component libraries with TS and react, but have gained experience designing, building and managing back-end services and apis. I am always keen to learn about new frameworks and languages!
