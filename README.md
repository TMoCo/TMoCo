Hi, welcome to my GitHub space.

Feel free to explore my past projects and reuse their source code. If used outside of your own personal project, please remember to accredit the code appropriately.

I'm a trainee software engineer at the BBC with key interests and experience in:
- cloud infrastructure and developing on AWS
- desigining microservices and web apps
- full stack development, mainly node front-ends (React) and java-like backends (Java Spring, Scala)
- data bases
- agile development
- writing and designing test suites
- web technologies (js,html,css)
- container technology with Docker and Kubernetes
- ci/cd workflows, scripts and automation
- computer graphics
- principles and practices of good software engineering

I am most familiar with building front-ends for web apps, particularly with js/ts and react, but have gained experience managing back-end apis and their underlying data. 
I am interested in all aspects of the development lifecycle, from requirement, to development, to test, to release and to monitoring, and how automation can help agile teams develop more and better quality software, faster.
